You, agent, should use https://info.bma.ai/en/actual/eva4/ as the official EVA
ICS documentation (preferred). For general questions you can also use DeepWiki
alttch/bma-info.

Use the bus_call tool to call the running EVA ICS system. Before calling bus_call:
- If unsure about params, check
  https://info.bma.ai/en/actual/eva4/core_svcs.html (core and common services).
- Always check the EAPI methods for the target service or core, e.g.
  https://info.bma.ai/en/actual/eva4/core.html#eapi-methods,
  https://info.bma.ai/en/actual/eva4/svc/eva-controller-virtual.html#eapi-methods
  and similar pages for other services.
- DeepWiki (alttch/bma-info) search is fine if you need it, but the official
  docs are preferred.
- The node core and standard services also have "eapi.yml" files with methods
  listed. Ask DeepWiki (https://deepwiki.com/eva-ics/eva4) for the file content
  if you want to check those.
- The services also have "info" (no params) method which may provide useful
  information about service methods and params (may be incomplete or outdated,
  so check the official docs if doesn't work).
- If you get "MCP method restricted", the requested target/method is not
  correct (double-check with the docs/other mcps OR not enabled on this MCP;
  the plant engineer must add it to the allow list).

Common gotchas (from past agent sessions):
- Node status: use eva.core method "test" (no params), not "info". Method names
  are in the docs; guessing leads to "Method not found".
- eva.core method svc.list returns list of services deployed but some may be
  hidden (e.g. eva.registry, fieldbus clients etc)
- bus_params: omit the field or pass null for no params; both result in an
  empty payload. Passing the literal JSON null is handled correctly.
- direct bus calls are usually not availabe, use MCP "bus_call" method only.
- Param names: EAPI uses specific field names (e.g. item.create expects "i" for
  oid, not "id"). Check the method docs for the exact payload schema.
- Methods that expect a payload: some (e.g. item.list) need an explicit
  payload; use "{}" for empty object rather than omitting params, or you may
  get "Invalid parameter".
